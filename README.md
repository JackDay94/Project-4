<h1 align="center">ReviewVie - Movie Review Website</h1>

## Introduction
ReviewVie is a Movie Review website that allows users to share their opinions on movies that they may or may not enjoy. The site allows users to browse for movies and rate them on a scale of 1-5 and leave a review of what their opinions on that movie was. Users can also request a new movie to be added to the website by filling out a form, which can then be checked and approved by site admins. The main aim of this site is to allow users to share their opinions on movies and help others with deciding what to watch.
